# Singapore's Education and Security

__Disclaimer: This article is an effort solely by Fabian Lim, written from my point of view and does not represent any organization.__

## Let me lay the premises - facts, figures and history

### Introducing English in the Education System
In 1965, the Singapore government merged the ethnically diverse educational streams into a single national system with the adoption of bilingual education policy (English and the Mother Tongues).
Students who attended schools with the national system after 1965 had bilingual education.

Assuming a child starts school at age 6 in the year 1965, he / she will experience the benefits of a bilingual education system. Vice versa, assuming a child that had already started school in 1965 will continue to follow the same (non-bilingual) system through out his education.

Fast forward to 2016, we can safely deduce that majority of the people (population BELOW the age of 56) who started attending schools before 1965 had very little or none of the bilingual education and English is not a language within their mastery.

Here are some references to Singapore's education system:

### Estimated Population that Did Not Grasp English
As of 2016, according to data at http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/visualising-data/charts/age-pyramid-of-resident-population, there are about 1 million Singaporean residents above 56 years old.

Also, according to http://www.singstat.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/statistics/visualising_data/population-trends2016.pdf, the Singaporean residential population is 3.93 million.

From a statistics point of view, that is about 1 out of 4 people who do not have mastery over English possibly due to the lack of education during their time.

## Let Me Paint the Picture - How this matters

If I may deduce why English was used as the main language of choice in today's technology: Most technologies we use today is about data transfer over the Internet. If you are familiar with the history of Internet (http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet), it first started in DARPA (in MIT) as `ARPANET` and later spread across the entire world. Different protocols on top of the Internet are later written to different the many types of data traffic. However, all protocols and programming languages are all written in English. Slowly but surely, other tools and technologies that ride on this Internet are also essentially written in English. Needless to say the concept of 'username' and 'password' is also, incepted in the same manner. Although some websites can extend its language abilities to accept characters but that will require custom libraries and handling that is out of the norm for a small-to-medium sized tech company. There are talks about passwords being obsolete in the future but I personally think that they are going to stay for a while. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Persistence-authorcopy.pdf)

Merging the 2 stories above together, the picture might be clearer on why there are parts of the Singapore population who has a weak grasp of English, can be hinders their ability to manage their username and password

and the concept of username and password, much less security.

Remembering Numbers (still okay)-> Alphanumeric (tough) -> Alphanumeric with symbols (wtf?)

The lack of knowledge translates into certain social behaviors.

Older generations rely on and trusts the younger generations to help them with technology. Or they trust the service provider with username and passwords, and even the 2FA token - compromising their security with even realising the risks and impact they have just incurred.
Perfect target for digital crimes
Spams keep happening (stats from crime)

NRIC numbers

Vectors of attack is HUGE. Banking, Personal Information, Identity frauds.
Trust or ignorance?

Not limited to Singapore but other countries that do not have English although I dare not 100% draw a conclusion on that but similar circumstances.

# Interesting Solutions

## English Aside, Assume All Equal Now, Maybe Security Education Next?

Use native Singlish passphrases - they are perfect non-dictionary words that aren't found in commonly found in dictionaries. One interesting example can be: `2912jiaksimi?` - it translates to Singlish for "Tonight want to jiak simi?" - which ultimately means "What do you want to eat for dinner tonight?" We have an advantage in this because Singlish was made and understood only by Singaporeans.

This was better before Oxford added Singlish words to their dictionary.
Education should come along with the use of technology which includes caveats and hacks (http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shiok-19-singlish-items-added-to-the-oxford-english-dictionary)

Technology without security education can be exploited.
SingPass was a good tool to increase security but it is still just a tool. Human layer breeched!

We need to instill Singapore citizens with the a security mindset through campaigns, like we did for staying vigilant against physical terrorism. The threats are real. (INSERT read about nation state digital warfare)

Lucky to be in the newer generation and thankful for my knowledge and ability to master both languages.
